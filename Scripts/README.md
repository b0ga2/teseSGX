## Virtual Environment Setup

This project uses a Python virtual environment to ensure all work with the same dependencies.

### Create and activate the virtual environment
`python -m venv venv`

Activate the environment:

**Windows**

`venv\Scripts\activate`

**Linux / macOS**

`source venv/bin/activate`

### Install the required packages

All necessary libraries (including pandas and pyargon2) are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Install them with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
