abstract = {As the sensitivity of position, the privacy protection in both 5G positioning and its further application in location-based services (LBSs) has been paid special attention and studied. Solutions based on k-anonymity, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation have been proposed. However, these solutions either require a trusted third party or incur heavy overheads. Besides, there still lacks an integrated solution that can protect privacy for both positioning and LBS provision. Based on Intel SGX, this article proposes a novel light-weight scheme that can protect privacy in both 5G positioning and its further applications in LBS provision in an integrated way. Through secret sharing, the proposed scheme can also support multiple location-based service providers without frequent key exchange. We seriously analyze the security of our scheme. Based on scheme implementation, its efficiency is proved through the performance evaluation conducted over a real-world database.},

abstract = {Privacy-preserving multi-party machine learning allows multiple organizations to perform collaborative data analytics while guaranteeing the privacy of their individual datasets. Using trusted SGX-processors for this task yields high performance, but requires a careful selection, adaptation, and implementation of machine-learning algorithms to provably prevent the exploitation of any side channels induced by data-dependent access patterns.We propose data-oblivious machine learning algorithms for support vector machines, matrix factorization, neural networks, decision trees, and k-means clustering. We show that our efficient implementation based on Intel Skylake processors scales up to large, realistic datasets, with overheads several orders of magnitude lower than with previous approaches based on advanced cryptographic multi-party computation schemes.},

abstract = {We present DarkneTZ, a framework that uses an edge device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in conjunction with model partitioning to limit the attack surface against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Increasingly, edge devices (smartphones and consumer IoT devices) are equipped with pre-trained DNNs for a variety of applications. This trend comes with privacy risks as models can leak information about their training data through effective membership inference attacks (MIAs).We evaluate the performance of DarkneTZ, including CPU execution time, memory usage, and accurate power consumption, using two small and six large image classification models. Due to the limited memory of the edge device's TEE, we partition model layers into more sensitive layers (to be executed inside the device TEE), and a set of layers to be executed in the untrusted part of the operating system. Our results show that even if a single layer is hidden, we can provide reliable model privacy and defend against state of the art MIAs, with only 3\% performance overhead. When fully utilizing the TEE, DarkneTZ provides model protections with up to 10\% overhead.},

abstract = {Data-driven intelligent applications in modern online services have become ubiquitous. These applications are usually hosted in the untrusted cloud computing infrastructure. This poses significant security risks since these applications rely on applying machine learning algorithms on large datasets which may contain private and sensitive information.To tackle this challenge, we designed secureTF, a distributed secure machine learning framework based on Tensorflow for the untrusted cloud infrastructure. secureTF is a generic platform to support unmodified TensorFlow applications, while providing end-to-end security for the input data, ML model, and application code. secureTF is built from ground-up based on the security properties provided by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, it extends the trust of a volatile memory region (or secure enclave) provided by the single node TEE to secure a distributed infrastructure required for supporting unmodified stateful machine learning applications running in the cloud.The paper reports on our experiences about the system design choices and the system deployment in production use-cases. We conclude with the lessons learned based on the limitations of our commercially available platform, and discuss open research problems for the future work.},

abstract = {We propose and implement a Privacy-preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) framework for mobile systems to limit privacy leakages in federated learning. Leveraging the widespread presence of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in high-end and mobile devices, we utilize TEEs on clients for local training, and on servers for secure aggregation, so that model/gradient updates are hidden from adversaries. Challenged by the limited memory size of current TEEs, we leverage greedy layer-wise training to train each model's layer inside the trusted area until its convergence. The performance evaluation of our implementation shows that PPFL can significantly improve privacy while incurring small system overheads at the client-side. In particular, PPFL can successfully defend the trained model against data reconstruction, property inference, and membership inference attacks. Furthermore, it can achieve comparable model utility with fewer communication rounds (0.54\texttimes{}) and a similar amount of network traffic (1.002\texttimes{}) compared to the standard federated learning of a complete model. This is achieved while only introducing up to ~15\% CPU time, ~18\% memory usage, and ~21\% energy consumption overhead in PPFL's client-side.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach to privacy-preserving machine learning. However, recent works reveal that gradients can leak private data. Using trusted SGX-processors for this task yields gradient-preserving but requires to prevent exploitation of any side-channel attacks.In this work, we present ShuffleFL, a gradient-preserving system using trusted SGX, which combines random group structure and intra-group gradient segment aggregation for combating any side-channel attacks. We analyze the security of our system against semi-honest adversaries. ShuffleFL effectively guarantees the participants' gradient privacy. We demonstrate the performance of ShuffleFL and show its applicability in the federated learning system.},
