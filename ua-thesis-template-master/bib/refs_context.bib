abstract = {Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) is an architectural extension in the 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processor that supports confidential computing. TDX allows the deployment of virtual machines in the Secure-Arbitration Mode (SEAM) with encrypted CPU state and memory, integrity protection, and remote attestation. TDX aims at enforcing hardware-assisted isolation for virtual machines and minimize the attack surface exposed to host platforms, which are considered to be untrustworthy or adversarial in the confidential computing’s new threat model. TDX can be leveraged by regulated industries or sensitive data holders to outsource their computations and data with end-to-end protection in public cloud infrastructures.This article aims at providing a comprehensive understanding of TDX to potential adopters, domain experts, and security researchers looking to leverage the technology for their own purposes. We adopt a top-down approach, starting with high-level security principles and moving to low-level technical details of TDX. Our analysis is based on publicly available documentation and source code, offering insights from security researchers outside of Intel.},

abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a feature of modern central processing units (CPUs) that aim to provide a high assurance, isolated environment in which to run workloads that demand both confidentiality and integrity. Hardware and software components in the CPU isolate workloads, commonly referred to as Trusted Applications (TAs), from the main operating system (OS). This article aims to analyse the TEE ecosystem, determine its usability, and suggest improvements where necessary to make adoption easier. To better understand TEE usage, we gathered academic and practical examples from a total of 223 references. We summarise the literature and provide a publication timeline, along with insights into the evolution of TEE research and deployment. We categorise TAs into major groups and analyse the tools available to developers. Lastly, we evaluate trusted container projects, test performance, and identify the requirements for migrating applications inside them.},

abstract={ Computations are now routinely delegated to third-parties. In response, Confidential Computing technologies are being added to microprocessors offering a trusted execution environment (TEE) that provides confidentiality and integrity guarantees to code and data hosted within—even in the face of a privileged attacker. TEEs, along with an attestation protocol, permit remote third-parties to establish a trusted “beachhead” containing known code and data on an otherwise untrusted machine. Yet, they introduce many new problems, including: how to ease provisioning of computations safely into TEEs; how to develop distributed systems spanning multiple classes of TEE; and what to do about the billions of “legacy” devices without support for Confidential Computing? Tackling these problems, we introduce Veracruz, a pragmatic framework that eases the design and implementation of complex privacy-preserving, collaborative, delegated computations among a group of mutually mistrusting principals. Veracruz supports multiple isolation technologies and provides a common programming model and attestation protocol across all of them, smoothing deployment of delegated computations over supported technologies. We demonstrate Veracruz in operation, on private in-cloud object detection on encrypted video streaming from a video camera. In addition to supporting hardware-backed TEEs—like AWS Nitro Enclaves and Arm Confidential Computing Architecture Realms—Veracruz also provides pragmatic “software TEEs” on Armv8-A devices without hardware Confidential Computing capability, using the high-assurance seL4 microkernel and our IceCap framework. },
