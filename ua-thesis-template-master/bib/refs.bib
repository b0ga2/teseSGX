abstract = {As the sensitivity of position, the privacy protection in both 5G positioning and its further application in location-based services (LBSs) has been paid special attention and studied. Solutions based on k-anonymity, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation have been proposed. However, these solutions either require a trusted third party or incur heavy overheads. Besides, there still lacks an integrated solution that can protect privacy for both positioning and LBS provision. Based on Intel SGX, this article proposes a novel light-weight scheme that can protect privacy in both 5G positioning and its further applications in LBS provision in an integrated way. Through secret sharing, the proposed scheme can also support multiple location-based service providers without frequent key exchange. We seriously analyze the security of our scheme. Based on scheme implementation, its efficiency is proved through the performance evaluation conducted over a real-world database.},
